Robotic Process Automation

UiPath Components
- UiPath Studio: This component uses visual aids such as diagrams and flowcharts to design automation processes.
It also involves the coding and sequencing of these processes. It consists of Graphical User Interface (GUI) buttons, drag and drop features,
and pre-built templates.
- UiPath Robot (Desktop, PC): In this component, multiple bots are deployed to execute the automation processes using pre-defined rules.
- UiPath Orchestrator: This component functions as a web-based application that schedules, deploys, and manages processes.
